- Currently, I am a Ph.D candidate in the Robotics Institute at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Yu Wang](http://ragroup.ust.hk/).
- My research interests include robotic tactile sensing, manipulation, and bridging learning mechanisms to real robotic tasks. In detail, I have been developing a vision-based tactile sensor called FingerVision from low-level sensor driver to high-level sensor signal interpretation algorithms in the POV of robotic manipulation. Besides, I also investigated a new manipulation method call Top-pressing Sliding (TPS), interested ones can refer to my publications. 
- I graduated as B.E. from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2014, and M.S. from [National Tsing-Hua University (NTHU)](http://www.nthu.edu.tw/) in 2016, advised by [Prof. Yeh, Ting-Jen](http://www.pme.nthu.edu.tw/files/14-1265-74008,r4027-1.php?Lang=en) on dynamic system control.
