## Effective estimation of Contact force and torque using vision-based sensors. 
In this project, we propose a method that utilizes 
Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) to decompose displacement field of the soft skin when making contact with objects. With the decomposition, we obtain curl-free, divergence-free and harmony fields. Governed by multiple constraints, surface forces including tangential and normal forces, and torsion are computed by a model that is trained on a small size dataset with a supervised learning fashion. In comparison, our decomposition results in a more data-efficient computation pipeline, which is superior considering the difficulties in collecting huge amount of contact dataset.
