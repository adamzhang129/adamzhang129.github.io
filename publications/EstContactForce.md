## Abstract

Retrieving rich contact information from robotic tactile sensing has
been a challenging, yet significant task for the effective perception
of object properties that the robot interacts with. This work is
dedicated to developing an algorithm to estimate contact force and
torque for vision-based tactile sensors. We first introduce the
observation of the contact deformation patterns of hyperelastic
materials under ideal single-axial loads in simulation. Then based on
the observation, we propose a method of estimating surface forces and
torque from the contact deformation vector field with the
Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition (HHD) algorithm. Extensive experiments of
calibration and baseline comparison are followed to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of prediction error and
variance. The proposed algorithm is further integrated into a contact
force visualization module as well as a closed-loop adaptive grasp
force control framework and is shown to be useful in both visualization
of contact stability and minimum force grasping task.
